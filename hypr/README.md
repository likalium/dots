Here are the hyprland dotfiles. Don't expect awesome and incredible things, it's my first rice after all. But feel free to use it. Have fun!

Requirements:
 - Hyprland (obviously)
 - swww (optional - for wallpaper - if u want to use another wallpaper manager, don't forget to edit `hyprland.conf`)
 - lxde polkit (optionnal - in fact you just need a polkit, i don't care about the one you want to use, but if you choose another one you must change `hyprland.conf` for launching your polkit instead of lxpolkit)
 > For people who don't know what is a polkit: you know it's the sort of popup who appears when you need to enter sudo password to give administrator rights to an app. More details: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Polkit
 - swayidle (optional - if you want idle management)
 - [Bibata Modern classic](https://github.com/ful1e5/Bibata_Cursor) (optional - for the custom cursor - if u dont install it, change the setting to YOUR cursor, instead the cursor can be buggy)
 - hyprpicker ( optional - for colorpicking)
 - grimblast (optional - for screenshots) 

# Note
For any further help, check [Hyprland's wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org). Also this config uses Hyprland **git** version, so maybe you'll must adapt it if you use another version (e.g the package in the `community repo` of Arch Linux). Again, refers to the hyprland wiki in the case.
